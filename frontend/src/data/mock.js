    "My journey began in Nepal, where I earned my Bachelor's in Pharmacy from Pokhara University, igniting a passion for medicinal chemistry, and I continued my Master's at Wonkwang University in South Korea.",
    "Returning back to Nepal, I served as Lecturer to Program Coordinator at Universal College of Medical Sciences, Tribhuvan University, Nepal (2015-2020), where I helped establish the pharmacy department and mentored aspiring pharmacists.",
    "I pursued my PhD at the University of Canterbury, where I developed groundbreaking enantioselective synthesis methods for hydantoins.",
    "Today, as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Otago, I'm developing cancer-targeted biorthogonal prodrugs — innovative drug delivery systems designed to selectively target cancer cells while minimizing harm to healthy tissue."
